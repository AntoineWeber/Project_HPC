# Project_HPC

The goal of this project is to solve the N-Body problem with the Barnes-Hut algorithm on the GPU using the CUDA platform.

Thus far I solved the algorithm with the brute-force method and parallelized it on CUDA.
I also implemented the solver using the Barnes-Hut algorithm but sequentially on the CPU.
Now I have to parallelize the Barnes-Hut algorithm to run with CUDA.
